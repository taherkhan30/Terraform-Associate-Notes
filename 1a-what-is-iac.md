# What is IAC?

### History 
	• Traditionally what are infrastructure resources 
	• Virtualization - now physical and virtual 
	• Traditional - manul and error prone 
	• Virtual - software driven model to set up the infrastrucre
	
### Iac 
	• deine and provision infrastructure in a machine readable format. 
	• Iac is not just for cloud 

### Format 
	• Declarative - define desired outcome 
	• Imperative  - define process of provisioning 
	• Terraform is declaritive 
	• Relies on an intepretation engine 
	• Iac code can be versionised in a vcs 
	• Iac can be combined with other software practices such as ci/ci, testing, reusable components. 

INFRASTRUCTURE IS DEFINED AND PROVISIONED THROUGH MACHINE READABLE CODE. 

If it done through command line, portal or an API it is not considered IAC. 

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

Description 
Terraform generates execution plan 
Executes and builds the infrastructure
